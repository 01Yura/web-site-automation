    <h1>Selenoid and Configuration Access</h1>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>WARNING!</strong> I couldn't get Selenoid running on Windows 10
      and on MacBook with M1 chip (Apple Silicon), although there's a workaround
      for Mac, but it only works for Chrome. I managed to run it only on Linux
      (Ubuntu; it will probably work on other Linux distributions too).

      <h1>Common Selenoid Setup and Autotest Launch Errors</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Browser images specified in <code>browsers.json</code> are not
            downloaded.</strong
          ><br />
          Selenoid <em>does not</em> download them automatically, and tests
          don't start due to missing images. Download the required images
          manually.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Syntax errors in <code>browsers.json</code>.</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For <code>"chrome"</code> and <code>"opera"</code> the
              <code>path</code> key should be <code>"/"</code>, not
              <code>"/wd/hub"</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Typos in image name/version tag (often confusion in the placement
              of underscores or colons when specifying image version, ChatGPT is
              guilty of this).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong
            >Path errors in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> (volumes).</strong
          ><br />
          Due to incorrect paths, Selenoid can't see <code>browsers.json</code>,
          UI doesn't connect to Selenoid, and videos aren't written. Check
          directory mounting (paths specified in volumes) - this is a common
          error.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Video recording is configured incorrectly.</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Essentially, in <code>docker-compose</code> you just need to add
              an environment variable with an <u>absolute path</u> to the
              <code>video</code> folder:
              <pre>
environment:
  OVERRIDE_VIDEO_OUTPUT_DIR: /root/selenoid_with_video/video</pre
              >
              Here you can't use <code>${PWD}</code> or <code>./video</code> —
              an absolute path is required! You can read more about this in the
              official documentation:
              <a
                href="https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/#_video_recording"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                >aerokube.com/selenoid … video_recording</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Often people forget to pre-download the recorder image:
              <code>docker pull selenoid/video-recorder:latest-release</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              People forget that you can't use headless mode:
              <pre>Configuration.headless = true;</pre>
            </li>
            It should be removed completely, or replaced with
            <pre>Configuration.headless = false;</pre>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Problems on Windows 10 and Mac with M1 chip.</strong><br />
          Containers start, but the browser starts and immediately crashes. For
          Windows, no stable solution has been found; for Mac, there are
          workaround options only for Chrome. Recommendation: use a Linux host
          or VM/VPS (e.g., Ubuntu Server 22.04, ≥10&nbsp;GB disk, ≥2&nbsp;GB
          RAM).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong
            >Incorrect IP address of the tested application in tests.</strong
          ><br />
          In a container, you can't use <code>localhost</code> to access an
          application running <em>outside</em> the container - specify the real
          host IP address. <br />Correct example:
          <pre>Configuration.baseUrl = "http://192.168.0.127:3000";</pre>
          Incorrect example:
          <pre>Configuration.baseUrl = "http://localhost:3000";</pre>
          Here you must use an IP address, not localhost, because this URL is
          substituted into the browser address bar opened in the Docker
          container, and if you specify localhost, the container will think that
          the application is also running inside the same container, but it is
          not running in it.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Manual browser check in UI.</strong><br />
          In general, after installing Selenoid, Selenoid UI and downloading
          browser images, you need to make sure that browsers can open at least
          manually, so that later, if something doesn't work, you understand
          whether it's a problem with tests or Selenoid configuration. For this,
          after starting Selenoid (docker-compose up -d), go to its
          ip_address:8080, at the top right there should be 2 CONNECTED labels,
          then go to the CAPABILITIES tab, select a browser from the dropdown
          list (if there's no list, then there's a problem with browsers.json or
          the path to it) and launch it manually. A browser window should
          appear. If it appears, congratulations - Selenoid is configured, now
          the main thing is to correctly write everything in the tests
          themselves.
