    <h1>Selenoid and Configuration Access</h1>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>WARNING!</strong> I couldn't get Selenoid running on Windows 10
      with certain versions of Docker Desktop (I don't remember which exactly,
      but below is a link to a working Docker Desktop for Windows 4.49.0 exe,
      it definitely works) and on MacBook with M1 chip (Apple Silicon), although
      there's a workaround for Mac (<a

        >link</a
      >), but it only works for Chrome version 91. I managed to run it only on
      Linux (Ubuntu; it will probably work on other Linux distributions too), on
      Windows 11, and on newer MacBooks.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Selenoid does not download browser images automatically, so
              tests don't start due to missing images. You need to manually
              download the browser images specified in the
              <code>browsers.json</code> file.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              For "chrome" and "opera" browsers the <code>path</code> key in
              <code>browsers.json</code> must be <code>"/"</code>, not
              <code>"/wd/hub"</code>. For "firefox" the key stays
              <code>"/wd/hub"</code>. Be careful with this, otherwise the
              browser won't start.
            </li>
            <li>
              Typos in the image name or browser version tag in
              <code>browsers.json</code> (often confusion in the placement of
              underscores or colons when specifying image version; ChatGPT is
              guilty of this). For example, instead of
              <code>selenoid/vnc_chrome:128.0</code> it's written
              <code>selenoid/vnc_chrome_128.0</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          >
          <ul>
            <li>
              Due to incorrect paths, Selenoid can't see
              <code>browsers.json</code>, UI doesn't connect to Selenoid, and
              videos aren't written. Check directory mounting (paths specified
              as volumes)—this is a common error.
            </li>

          <strong

          <ul>
            <li>
              Essentially, in docker-compose.yml you just need to add an
              environment variable with an <u>absolute path</u> to the
              <code>video</code> folder:
              <pre>
environment:
  OVERRIDE_VIDEO_OUTPUT_DIR: /root/selenoid_with_video/video</pre
              >
              You can't use <code>${PWD}</code> or <code>./video</code> here—an
              absolute path is required! You can read more about this in the
              official documentation:
              <a
                href="https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/#_video_recording"
                target="_blank"

                >aerokube.com/selenoid … video_recording</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plus, people often forget to pre-download the recorder image
              (Selenoid won't download it itself and video recording won't
              work):
              <code>docker pull selenoid/video-recorder:latest-release</code>.
              You do not need to add this image to docker-compose.yml; it will
              start automatically—the main thing is to download it once.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can't use headless mode in tests:
              <pre>Configuration.headless = true;</pre>
              The value should be removed completely or replaced with
              <pre>Configuration.headless = false;</pre>
              If there's no screen, there's nothing to record.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

            >Problems on Windows 10 with some versions of Docker Desktop and Mac

          <ul>
            <li>
              Containers start, but the browser starts and immediately crashes.
              If you use Windows, download Docker Desktop version 4.49.0; for
              Mac there are workaround options only for Chrome version 91 (

              Server 22.04, ≥10&nbsp;GB disk, ≥2&nbsp;GB RAM), a newer MacBook,
              or Windows 11.

            >Common error: Incorrect IP address of the tested application in
            tests.</strong

          <ul>
            <li>
              In a container, you can't use <code>localhost</code> to access an
              application running outside the container—specify the real host IP
              address. <br />Correct example:
              <pre>Configuration.baseUrl = "http://192.168.0.127:3000";</pre>
              Incorrect example:
              <pre>Configuration.baseUrl = "http://localhost:3000";</pre>
              An IP address is required here, not localhost, because this URL
              is used in the address bar of the browser opened in the Docker
              container, and if you specify localhost, the container will assume
              the application is running inside the same container, but it is
              not.

          <strong>Manual browser check in UI.</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In general, after installing Selenoid, Selenoid UI and downloading
              browser images, you need to make sure that browsers open at least
              manually, so that later, if something doesn't work, you can tell
              whether the issue is in the tests or in Selenoid configuration. For
              this, after starting Selenoid (docker-compose up -d), go to its
              IP_address:8080; at the top right there should be 2 CONNECTED
              labels, then go to the CAPABILITIES tab, select a browser from the
              dropdown list (if there's no list, the problem is with
              browsers.json or the path to it) and launch it manually. A browser
              window should appear. If it appears—congratulations, Selenoid is
              configured; now the main thing is to set everything up correctly in
              the tests themselves.
